# NFT-Backed Career Counseling Sessions

## Description
This project leverages blockchain technology to offer career counseling sessions backed by NFTs. Users who own specific NFTs can book career counseling sessions with registered counselors. The system ensures authenticity and exclusivity by verifying NFT ownership on the Aptos blockchain.

## Vision of the Project
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and trustless career guidance platform where individuals can access quality counseling services based on their NFT ownership. This approach ensures that access to counseling services is token-gated, providing value to both counselors and users.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Decentralized Identity (DID):** Enhancing user authentication and verification.
- **Multi-NFT Support:** Allowing multiple NFTs to grant access to different levels of counseling sessions.
- **AI-Powered Career Recommendations:** Using AI to enhance career advice based on user profiles and interests.
- **Marketplace for Sessions:** Creating a secondary market where users can trade session access.
- **Reputation System:** Implementing a rating mechanism for counselors to ensure service quality.

## Contract Details
- **Contract Address:**  0xc12968fbd684b6c208679b8bf613e1b54b32ec2e1053ccae5bb9b520ee8e9a12
